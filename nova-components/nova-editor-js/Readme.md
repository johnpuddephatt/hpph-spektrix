A Laravel Nova implementation of [Editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) by [@advoor](https://github.com/advoor).

## Installation

Install via composer:

```
composer require advoor/nova-editor-js
```

Publish the config file
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Advoor\NovaEditorJs\FieldServiceProvider"
```

## Version Compatibility

Laravel Nova 4.x isn't backwards compatible with 3.x, so we had to make a version split.
Please use the below table to find which versions are suitable for your installation.

| Package version | Nova Version | Laravel Version | PHP version |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `3.x`           | 4.x          | 8.x - 9.x       | 8.1+        |
| `2.x`           | 2.x - 3.x    | 5.x - 8.x       | 5.6 - 7.4   |

Note that we really pushed the PHP version up. If you're staying on
new versions of Laravel and Nova, we're expecting your PHP version to match that behaviour.

## Upgrade

See [the upgrade guide](./UPGRADING.md).

## Usage

To add EditorJS to your application, you'll need to modify your Nova resource.
For ease-of-use we also recommend to update your models, but that's optional.

### Updating your Nova resource

This package exposes a `NovaEditorJsField` that takes care of displaying the HTML contents
and providing the user with the EditorJS field.

To use it, simply import the field,

```php
use Advoor\NovaEditorJs\NovaEditorJsField;
```

use it in your fields array,

```php
return [
    // â€¦
    NovaEditorJsField::make('about'),
];
```

And boom, you've got yourself a fancy editor.

### Updating your models (optional)

For ease-of-use, we recommend you add the `NovaEditorJsCast` to the `$casts` on your models.
This will map the value to a `NovaEditorJsData` model, which can be returned in Blade (rendering HTML), or sent
via API calls (rendering JSON, unless you call `toHtml` on it or cast it to a string).

```php
use Advoor\NovaEditorJs\NovaEditorJsCast;

class User extends Model {
    protected $casts = [
        'about' => NovaEditorJsCast::class,
    ];
}
```

Since the `NovaEditorJsData` model is an `Htmlable`, Blade will recognize it as
safe HTML. This means you don't have to use Blade "unescaped statements".

```blade
<article>
    <h1>About {{ $user->name }}</h1>
    {{ $user->about }}
</article>
```

### Rendering HTML without model changes

You can also use the `NovaEditorJs` facade to render HTML from stored data.

```php
NovaEditorJs::generateHtmlOutput($user->about);
```

The return value of `generateHtmlOutput` is an `HtmlString`, which is treated as
safe by Blade. This means you don't have to use Blade "unescaped statements".

```blade
<article>
    <h1>About {{ $user->name }}</h1>
    {{ NovaEditorJs::generateHtmlOutput($user->about) }}
</article>
```

## Customizing

You can configure what tools the Editor should use, by updating the `toolSettings` property in the config file.
By default, the following components are enabled:

* [Header](https://github.com/editor-js/header)
* [Image](https://github.com/editor-js/image)
* [Link](https://github.com/editor-js/link)
* [List](https://github.com/editor-js/list)
* [Code block](https://github.com/editor-js/code)
* [Inline code](https://github.com/editor-js/inline-code)
* [Checklist](https://github.com/editor-js/checklist)
* [Marker](https://github.com/editor-js/marker)
* [Embeds](https://github.com/editor-js/embed)
* [Delimiter](https://github.com/editor-js/delimiter)
* [Table](https://github.com/editor-js/table)
* [Raw](https://github.com/editor-js/raw)

You can customize the views for each component, by changing the view in `resources/views/vendor/nova-editor-js/`.

### Registering custom components
